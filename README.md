This is a personal mod of the Red Star OS icon theme.

Original theme link: https://store.kde.org/p/1677968

It adds theming for KDE apps icons so they have Red Star OS app icons.

Note: This icon theme is set to inherit crystalsvg, which seems to be the base icon theme used in Red Star OS

You can get it from either Red Star OS or https://github.com/BlackOtton/RedStar-Media
